# OpenGL Graphics Project

## Introduction
This repository contains a **real-time graphics application** developed in **C++ using OpenGL**.  
The project focuses on implementing a modern rendering pipeline, shader-based rendering, and real-time interaction, serving as a practical exploration of core computer graphics concepts.

The project was developed as part of a **Computer Graphics course** to demonstrate understanding of GPU-based rendering, transformations, lighting, and engine-style architecture.

## Features
- Modern OpenGL rendering (shader-based pipeline)
- Vertex and fragment shaders written in GLSL
- Model loading using Assimp
- Real-time transformations (model, view, projection)
- Camera system for scene navigation
- Basic lighting model (e.g. Phong / Blinn-Phong)
- GUI tools using ImGui
- Audio support using FMOD
- JSON-based data handling using RapidJSON
